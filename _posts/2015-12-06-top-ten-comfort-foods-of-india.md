Food is one of the most primitive forms of comfort. It provides instant relief from physical hunger. However our relationship with food is a far more complex as it has the power to change our emotions and alter our moods. As children, we have all indulged in eating to satisfy our emotional hunger rather than pure physical needs. We live in world where people bond over food and most social interactions are centered around a meal. Comfort foods (often high carb foods) provide a nostalgic or sentimental feeling and remind one of home, family and friends. They are eaten for psychological reasons rather than nutritional.

Comfort eating has a complete life of its own. People, when under emotional stress, often reach for a packet of chips or a soft drink. Overtime, it becomes a habit as the brain learns to look for the same stimulus whenever under stress. The problem is not in comfort eating but in eating junk for comfort and overeating it. Comfort foods are misused as people regularly turn to them to cope with stress, anxiety, fear, depression and negative emotions.
It is a great and healthy idea to try comfort foods but in moderation.
Here is a list of top ten Comfort foods that Indian’s indulge in to get rid of their blues.
1.The two minute Maggi noodles (shown in pic): Any time snack it is right on top of the list of “happy foods”. Very nostalgic, reminds you of your time in the hostel when hunger struck at twelve in the night with nowhere to go.
2.Stuffed Paranthas (shown in pic): Paneer, potato, onion radish or cauliflower paranthas with pickle, curd and butter on top ....always remind one of the warmth of mom’s kitchen.
3.Khichdi/Rajma Chawal: It brings back memories of lying in bed in front of the TV and indulging in this hot, simple and healthy preparation.
4.Idli sambar: Rice idlis with bowls of hot sambhar are definitely mood elevating and remind one of a great breakfast.
5.Pakoras, samosas and chai (tea): Nothing to match these on a gloomy, cloudy rainy day. The satisfaction lasts for ever.
6.Gulab jamun (shown in pic) and jalebi’s: A high calorie indulgence, served piping hot and very often bought from the neighborhood sweet shop rather than made at home. Pure delight.
7.Aloo bhujiya and Banana chips: This one is for the person who loves salty food. You will not stop until you finish the whole pack and still want more.
8.Tandoori chicken: For the north Indian, biting into the “leg piece” is sheer delight and not dependent on his real hunger. Eating a tandoori chicken gives one feeling of complete liberation and freedom.
9.Momos: Steaming hot momos - chicken, or vegetarian are great mood lifters.
10.Pav bhaji: Finely-chopped vegetables, cooked in heaps of butter and masala is the greatest gift to mankind.
Nothing like Comfort foods to give your mood a lift but don’t overindulge.
