In the biblical story, when the Israelis send the puny David to fight the giant Philistine Goliath with stones and a sling, the latter thinks it is a joke. David pulls out a stone, puts it into his sling and shoots at Goliath who falls to the ground. When the rest of the Philistines see this they run away. David becomes a hero for the people of Israel.
