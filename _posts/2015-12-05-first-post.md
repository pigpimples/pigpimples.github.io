How much do you dislike Arvind Kejriwal?

In the biblical story, when the Israelis send the puny David to fight the giant Philistine Goliath with stones and a sling, the latter thinks it is a joke. David pulls out a stone, puts it into his sling and shoots at Goliath who falls to the ground. When the rest of the Philistines see this they run away. David becomes a hero for the people of Israel.

In 2012-13, a mass based struggle against corruption propelled Arvind Kejriwal to stratospheric heights of public imagination and discourse. He achieved political success within 13 months of forming his party. His party got a 30% vote share in the 2013 Delhi elections and he became Chief Minister, defeating the three time sitting CM. It was something of a shocker for the BJP and the ruling Congress.

Kejriwal became the modern day David.

Forty nine days later when he quit from the CM post, he was a man with a destiny, few would envy.
A former civil servant, a IIT mechanical engineer, Ramon Magsaysay Award winner, social activist and a full time politician, Kejriwal is a force to reckon with. He is a man in a hurry. He will stop at nothing - not even his destination. He is the crusade and the crusader, the foot soldier and the General, the joke and the joker, the hero and the villain, the god and its idol, the product and its packaging.

Martin Luther King said in 1963; "I have a dream." Rajiv Gandhi, the Indian Prime Minister, told the US Congress 22 years later, "I too have a dream." Three decades later, Kejriwal is selling another dream to the Indian middle class.
In the recently launched "Delhi Dialogue" (Nov 2014), an attempt to recapture the throne of Delhi, he is promising free Wi-Fi for the national capital, 8 lakh jobs, training for 10 lakh youths, 20 new colleges, doubling seats in existing 70 colleges, reducing VAT, gender security, electricity, water, sanitation, housing and making Delhi a world class city. Kejriwal "the dream seller" dressed in his trademark muffler and floaters (his attire reminds one of a neighbourhood watchman) is back again.
Nine months later, he is on a comeback trail and this time he is not riding on a high horse. He says, "I have learnt my lesson, I will never resign again."
Support for him comes from unexpected quarters; the auto drivers, the lower middle class, people living in slums and the literate middle class. He has a fan following of 2.8 million on twitter and is a darling of the social media. His "Delhi Dialogue" attracted 1.2 lakh views on Facebook and 25,000 retweets in a day. He is also the butt of all jokes on social media (the latest being that he love’s Shakira’s hips because they don’t lie).
He keeps you guessing; Will he? Won’t he? He often does a U turn (In January 2014, prior to his resignation as chief minister, he said he would not contest a seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections but later contested). Can you really trust the man? Is he a maverick driven by personal ambition or is he fighting to bring about real change? Has he lost the plot? Will he get the crowds back? Will he actually deliver?
Marx said, "Politics is the art of looking for trouble." Kejriwal seems to have mastered it.
At the end as Delhi goes into another round of elections, only one question remains (asked in a recent India Today survey) uppermost in everyone’s mind; "How much do you dislike Arvind Kejriwal ?"
Undecided?
