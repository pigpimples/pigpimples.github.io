**Apple Car**. You are the proud owner a self driving Apple Car. The car has a mind of its own but it still lets you believe that you control it. It arrives at your door, in time for you to reach the destination mentioned in your Apple calendar. You open the door with your Apple watch or a fingerprint sensor. If you are going to the airport, the car reminds you to check your identification and medicine. Tickets and boarding passes are already scanned into your phone, and it ensures that the phone is with you in the car. It doesn't bother you with anything else after that. It auto plays your favorite music from iCloud or picks up an audio book from where you left it. Your iPhone automatically airplays your reminders, alerts, notifications to the big screen inside the vehicle so you can leave the phone in your pocket. You arrive at your destination, and the car warns you of the weather outside before you disembark. You are in a perky condition, but you are unable to articulate exactly why.

**Google Car**. You do not own a self driving Google car. Instead, you borrow a Google car which is idling close to you. It arrives at your door and it has your name flashing on the outside. You either use your phone or you stare into a camera to open the door. Once inside, it reminds you to confirm your destination and shows you the route. Next, it shows you the approximate cost. After that, it insists on playing a radio station that has been automatically selected for you. You just want to get moving so you say yes to everything it demands. On the way, the car shows you a few products that you might be interested in buying. You try to focus your mind on something else. You arrive at your destination slightly perturbed, but you are unable to articulate exactly why.
